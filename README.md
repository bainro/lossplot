visualize multiple loss landscapes simultaneously in browser

There's a demo here: [Link](https://rkbain.com/loss). <br/>
Be patient as ~10MB csv file has to be downloaded and parsed. <br/>
There's some other dataset links here: [Link 1](https://rkbain.com/loss/#1) [Link 2](https://rkbain.com/loss/#2) [Link 3](https://rkbain.com/loss/#3)

```
Go to localhost:8080 in your browser of choice ðŸ˜Ž
